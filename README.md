## 🤔 What's this project?
This is a practice app<br>
I wanted to check how Expo works and what does it provide<br>
Is it better than just react native (spoilers, it's not)<br><br>

## ❔ What's it about?
This is an emoji picker app <br>
You can select an emoji from the give list of emojis <br>
And put it on your image you selected <br>
And then download it, that's it <br>

## ✏️ How it looks like?
